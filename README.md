## Description
        
In this project, I created a note taking application that utilizes express to allow people to take notes and save and delete them as they please. Using local storage, the notes can be saved and accessed forever, and deleted whenever the user pleases. 

## Installation 

Just go to the website which is deployed on heroku! 

## Usage

After clicking "get started", you can add notes by typing in the fields and save them by clicking save in the top left, or you can view previously saved notes in the notes column on the right. 

## License

This application is covered under the MIT license.
